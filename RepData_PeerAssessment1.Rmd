This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(plyr)
data <- read.csv(file="activity.csv",head=T,stringsAsFactors=FALSE )



#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

#Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
steps.per.day <-tapply(data$steps,data$date,"sum",na.rm=TRUE) 
hist(steps.per.day)

#Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
mean(steps.per.day)
median(steps.per.day)

#What is the average daily activity pattern?
avgstepsinterval<-tapply(data$steps,data$interval,"mean",na.rm=TRUE) 

#Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
avgstepsinterval<-tapply(data$steps,data$interval,"mean",na.rm=TRUE) 
plot(names(avgstepsinterval),avgstepsinterval,type="l")

#Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
which.max(avgstepsinterval) 

#Imputing missing values

#Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
sum(is.na(data$steps))

# Merge original data with the average by interval data

# Find the NA positions
na_pos <- which(is.na(data$steps))

mean_vec <- rep(mean(data$steps, na.rm=TRUE), times=length(na_pos))


#Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
# Replace the NAs by the means
data[na_pos, "steps"] <- mean_vec


#Compute the total number of steps each day
summedData <- aggregate(data$steps, by=list(data$date), FUN=sum)

# Rename the attributes
names(summedData) <- c("date", "total")

# Compute the histogram of the total number of steps each day
hist(summedData$total, 
     breaks=seq(from=0, to=23000, by=1500),
     xlab="Total numbers of steps", 
     col="blue",    
     ylim=c(0, 50), 
     main="The total number of steps taken each day")

#Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
library(lattice)
weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
              "Friday")
data$dow = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(data$date)),weekdays), "Weekday", "Weekend"))
intervalSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, data, mean)
xyplot(intervalSteps$steps ~ intervalSteps$interval|intervalSteps$dow, main="Average Steps per Day by Interval",xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps",layout=c(1,2), type="l")





```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
